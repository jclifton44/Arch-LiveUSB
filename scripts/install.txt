   Use timedatectl(1) to ensure the system clock is accurate:
# timedatectl set-ntp true


# fdisk -l

#/dev/sda2 EFI
#/dev/sda6 root partition 
#/dev/sda7 swap partition


   Once the partitions have been created, each must be formatted with an
   appropriate file system. For example, to format the root partition on
   /dev/sda1 with ext4, run:
# mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda6

  Mount the file systems
   Mount the file system on the root partition to /mnt, for example:
# mount /dev/sda6  /mnt

   Create mount points for any remaining partitions and mount them
   accordingly, for example:
# mkdir /mnt/boot
# mount /dev/sda2 /mnt/boot

   Use the pacstrap script to install the base package group:
# pacstrap /mnt base

   This group does not include all tools from the live installation, such
   as btrfs-progs or specific wireless firmware; see packages.both for
   comparison.

   To install packages and other groups such as base-devel, append the
   names to pacstrap (space separated) or to individual pacman commands
   after the #Chroot step.

Configure the system

# genfstab -U /mnt >> /mnt/etc/fstab

# arch-chroot /mnt

# ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/Region/City /etc/localtime

   Run hwclock(8) to generate /etc/adjtime:
# hwclock --systohc
   Uncomment en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8 and other needed localizations in
   /etc/locale.gen, and generate them with:
# locale-gen

   Set the LANG variable in locale.conf(5) accordingly, for example:
/etc/locale.conf
LANG=en_US.UTF-8

/etc/hostname
myhostname

   For Wireless configuration, install the iw and wpa_supplicant packages,
   as well as needed firmware packages. Optionally install dialog for
   usage of wifi-menu.

   recreate the initramfs image:
# mkinitcpio -p linux


   Set the root password:
# passwd

  Boot loader

   See Category:Boot loaders for available choices and configurations.

   If you have an Intel CPU, install the intel-ucode package in addition,
   and enable microcode updates.

Reboot

   Exit the chroot environment by typing exit or pressing Ctrl+D.

   Optionally manually unmount all the partitions with umount -R /mnt:
   this allows noticing any "busy" partitions, and finding the cause with
   fuser(1).

   Finally, restart the machine by typing reboot: any partitions still
   mounted will be automatically unmounted by systemd. Remember to remove
   the installation media and then login into the new system with the root
   account.

Post-installation

   See General recommendations for system management directions and
   post-installation tutorials (like setting up a graphical user
   interface, sound or a touchpad).

   For a list of applications that may be of interest, see List of
   applications.
