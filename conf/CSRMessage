There should be a .csr and .key file in your home folder.
The .key is the private key for a server. The .csr is a certificate signing request.
Send your .csr along with any requested info to your choice of Certificate Authority (CA)

Install the .key and the .crt they return in the following locations:
/etc/ssl/private/key.key
/etc/ssl/certs/crt.crt

Enjoy your SSL
