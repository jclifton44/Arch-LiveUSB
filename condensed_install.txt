   This group does not include all tools from the live installation, such
   as btrfs-progs or specific wireless firmware; see packages.both for
   comparison.
   To install packages and other groups such as base-devel, append the
   names to pacstrap (space separated) or to individual pacman commands
   after the #Chroot step.
Configure the system
# genfstab -U /mnt >> /mnt/etc/fstab
# arch-chroot /mnt

# ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/Region/City /etc/localtime

   Run hwclock(8) to generate /etc/adjtime:
# hwclock --systohc
   Uncomment en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8 and other needed localizations in
   /etc/locale.gen, and generate them with:
# locale-gen

   Set the LANG variable in locale.conf(5) accordingly, for example:
/etc/locale.conf
LANG=en_US.UTF-8

/etc/hostname
myhostname

   For Wireless configuration, install the iw and wpa_supplicant packages,
   as well as needed firmware packages. Optionally install dialog for
   usage of wifi-menu.

   recreate the initramfs image:
# mkinitcpio -p linux


   Set the root password:
# passwd

  Boot loader

   See Category:Boot loaders for available choices and configurations.

   If you have an Intel CPU, install the intel-ucode package in addition,
   and enable microcode updates.

Reboot

   Exit the chroot environment by typing exit or pressing Ctrl+D.

   Optionally manually unmount all the partitions with umount -R /mnt:
   this allows noticing any "busy" partitions, and finding the cause with
   fuser(1).

   Finally, restart the machine by typing reboot: any partitions still
   mounted will be automatically unmounted by systemd. Remember to remove
   the installation media and then login into the new system with the root
   account.

Post-installation

   See General recommendations for system management directions and
   post-installation tutorials (like setting up a graphical user
   interface, sound or a touchpad).

   For a list of applications that may be of interest, see List of
   applications.
